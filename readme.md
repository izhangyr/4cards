4Cards App Idea is to help people learn Good & sophisticated words so that they can sound 
smarter during their presentations, meeting & while meeting their friends. 4Cards teaches
just 1 word at a time & 4 words in a day, which means a person can lean 3600 great words in
a year. 

4Cards also shows meaning of the words in the native language of the User for better 
memorisation. 4Cards also encourages user to take Quiz in night just before sleeping so that they could
revise the words they have learnt in that day.

We have also implemented simple machine concepts to help the users get personalised experience.

First version of the App is very simple prototype which can be enhanced to the smartest App
to help people get confident at spoken English.
