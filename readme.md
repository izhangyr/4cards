English has its unique importance in India It has played a crucial role in building modern India.

At present, it is one of the major languages used for communication in the world. In our
country we have people living in different states speaking different languages. But here
English plays a vital role of a bridge. It helps different natives of different regional
dialects to communicate with each other. English is a language which links us with the
outside world. The prospects of employment for a person having knowledge of English are
bright in every country.

In India, people going from North to South for education or business mostly communicate in
English language, and it is one of the reasons that it has become a link language.
In India, the official language in corporate world is English. A
person can make rapid strides in the management ladder only if he can speak English
fluently.

If your English is poor, you will find yourself languishing at the bottom of the management
ladder, even though you may have a brilliant brain and can come up with brilliant business
ideas. Your productivity will drop over a period of time since you will find difficulty in
expressing your brilliant ideas. People who can speak good English will probably seize your
ideas and get the credit for all the hard work you did to get the idea working.
